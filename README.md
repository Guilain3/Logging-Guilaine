**QUESTION 1:**

**What is Logging?**

Logging is the process of recording information about the operation of a system or application.
This information can include events, errors, warnings, and other significant occurrences during the execution of a program. 
Logging helps track user activities, system performance, and potential issues in a web application.

Logs can be stored in various formats, such as text files, databases, or log management systems.
They can also be visualized and analyzed using tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack, Splunk, etc.

**QUESTION 2:**

**Why is logging important?**

Logging is crucial for several reasons:

->**Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Logs provide insights into the application's behavior, making it easier to identify and fix issues.

->**Monitoring and Maintenance:** Continuous monitoring of logs helps in maintaining the health of the application by detecting and addressing issues promptly.

->**Security Auditing:** Logs can record security-related events, such as unauthorized access attempts, which are essential for security audits.

->**Performance Analysis:** By analyzing logs, developers can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the application's performance.

->**Compliance and Legal Requirements:** In some industries, logging is a requirement for regulatory compliance and can provide an audit trail for legal purposes.

**QUESTION 3:**

**Understanding logging levels**
  
Logging Levels categorize the severity and importance of the log messages. Common logging levels, from most to least severe, include:

**->FATAL:** Severe errors causing the program to abort.

**->ERROR:** Serious issues that might allow the application to continue running but require attention.

**->WARN:** Potentially harmful situations that do not prevent the program from running but indicate a possible future problem.

**->INFO:** Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application.

**->DEBUG:** Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.

**->TRACE:** Finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG level, typically used for tracing the application's flow.

Different logging frameworks may have variations of these levels, but the core concept remains the same.
The choice of logging level depends on the information's importance and the potential impact on the system.
